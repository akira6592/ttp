Template Variables
==================

TTP supports definition of arbitrary variables using dedicated xml tags <v>, <vars> or <variables>. Withing these tags variables can be defined in various formats and loaded using one of supported loaders. Variables can also be defined in external text files and loaded using *include* attribute.

Various values can be recorded in template variables before, during or after parsing. That additional data can be added to results, used for dynamic path constructions.
